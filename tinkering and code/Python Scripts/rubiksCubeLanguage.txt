A estoric language on the rubiks cube that transpiles to python


Goal: To make the Rubiks Cube Turing Complete
    Supplies:
        A rubiks cube and an instruction pointer



How will I do this?:
    - You can use the colors of the cube
        - Maybe this is better for storing the program inside the cube itself?

        - each color represents an instruction
           - back two rows can store numbers and characters?

        - use a grid buffer?


    - Each color


    - You can use the turning notation
        - Can write programs using this notation


        - can a piece of paper be an instruction pointer?
